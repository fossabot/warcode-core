WarCode Core is used by standalone Risk browser games, bots, and multiplayer game services.

Notable characteristics
* â™¿ ES5 - transpiled code works in old browser and Node versions
* ðŸš« small package ~ 24 KB uncompressed
* ðŸŽ² caller controls randomness of dice and cards
* Î» functional JavaScript using an immutable data structure

It borrows from both the [event sourcing](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html)  and [State-Action-Model](http://sam.js.org/) patterns. It captures player actions and returns the state of the game as a single data structure.
