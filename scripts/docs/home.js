# Gameplay

Gameplay includes many phases. These are illustrated in the following state diagram.

![State Machine](./diagram.svg)

This state diagram contains the following
* ‚ñ° _States_ are moments in the game waiting on a player's move, such as rolling the dice.
* ‚óá _Pseudostates_ are temporary states that allow for conditional behavior while the processing a player's move.
